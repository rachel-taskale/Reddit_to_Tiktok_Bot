# Reddit_to_Tiktok_Bot
This project was my proof of concept to generate Tiktok videos from Reddit posts using Python video automation libraries.
If you wish to use this repo to generate your own Reddit videos then follow the steps below.



## How to use:
1. Get Reddit API access: https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api/
2. Insert your credentials into the set_up_reddit function under RedditScraper.py
3. Run npm i
4. Find a reddit post you want to turn into a video
5. Run python redditScraper.py and paste the url of the reddit post you like
